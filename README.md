# Kafka Challenge

this is my rust project for kafka challenge~~~

if you have any questions, please feel free to take an issue.
<!-- 
This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Kafka" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/kafka).

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Kafka clone that's capable of accepting
and responding to APIVersions & Fetch API requests. You'll also learn about
encoding and decoding messages using the Kafka wire protocol. You'll also learn
about handling the network protocol, event loops, TCP sockets and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your Kafka implementation is in `src/main.rs`. Study and
uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

```sh
git commit -am "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

That's all!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.54)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Kafka broker, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

2024-11-8 00:54:57 目前完成了基础部分，准备开始并发，需要用到tokie，因此需要先学习一波
2024-11-12 00:42:12 目前看完了4.6.2，该看4.6.3了，多线程看完之后就可以看tolie了~~~
2024年11月11日00:42:23：目前看到了:https://course.rs/advance-practice/overview.html 准备开始，而这里正好是tokie的开始
